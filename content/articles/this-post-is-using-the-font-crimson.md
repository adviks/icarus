I have learned this lesson hard way that eating something out of trash can be fatal. I reached this realization when I ate a cake out of the trash can down the street. It tasted good, but later that night-- my stomach started aching. I had to be admitted into ER.

This is not surprising at all. I have done this kind of thing earlier in my life.
