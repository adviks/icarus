Selling friendship bracelets on Etsy is not my cup of tea. I don’t want to spend my limited time on this earth on proposed side hustles you commonly find out there unless there is a relatively large payoff.

I have encountered and read about hundreds of ways to earn an extra buck thanks to good ‘ol Google. However, I found that a lot of them needed either:

1. Some sort of upfront financial investment
2. An unrealistic time commitment for little payback

Whether you are saving for an investment, a vacation, or just some extra spending money, having a side hustle can be a game-changer.

I thought, why not choose 3 side hustles and put them to the test! I gave each one 30 days in order to give them something to measure up to and to my utter surprise, they *each* earned in the $1000 ballpark!

Without further ado, here are three side hustles tested out by yours truly, listed from most profitable to least profitable.

# **Upselling Ikea Items From the ‘As Is’ Section**

This is by far my favorite of the three side hustles. I would actually describe this as more of a life hack than a side hustle and can see myself doing it …forever.

I discovered the idea through a YouTube channel called [“Our Rich Journey”](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChObmEJP3bgGUXJGc2ePP3Q). The couple who run the channel chased the FIRE movement (financial independence, retire early) and managed to retire before the age of 40 thanks to their incredible execution of stock market investing, real estate investing, and side hustles.

If you’re going to base your side hustle game off of anyone, this is the couple to do it with.

Essentially, you visit your local Ikea, go to the ‘as is’ section and search for ***largely*** discounted, minimally damaged items. Once purchased, post and sell them on private platforms such as Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, or Craigslist — dealers choice.

Over two trips I purchased:

* 3 identical bathroom vanities that cost $60 in total (they were heavily discounted at 70% off with no apparent damages. Full price would have been over $600)
* 1 kitchen table for $80 (this was also significantly discounted at 90% off, so it would have cost just north of $700 had it not been in the as-is section. The only damage was a small white paint stain that I scraped off).

A very important side note — because you are paying a small upfront cost, be sure to take a few minutes before you make your purchase to pull out your phone and do some research.

For example, if you plan on selling on Facebook Marketplace, take a quick look and see what comparable items are selling for so that you will not only make your money back, but you will also walk away with a healthy profit.

The drive home from my second trip was a bit of a low point. I was losing the high I had gotten from shopping and finding such good deals. I was quickly realizing that I was in the hole $140 and was questioning whether I was losing my mind in this quest for quick money.

But I persevered!

When I got home, I assembled one of the bathroom vanities so that people could see what it looked like built. I listed on Facebook Marketplace for competitive prices and then waited.

Luckily, I did not have to wait long. Within the first 10 days all three of the bathroom vanities sold.

* Vanity 1 sold for $180
* Vanity 2 sold for $180
* Vanity 3 sold for $170

And on day 19, the kitchen table I picked up for $80, sold for $625!

Let me break those numbers down for you — I spent $140 at the Ikea ‘As Is’ section, and 19 days later I made $1155…

> That is growth of 725%!

I don’t think I need to explain further why you should start doing this yesterday.

# Declutter Your Home & Sell Items Online

I like this option because as per the criteria I listed above, it had zero upfront costs and also required minimal time. Additionally, my house got a much needed de-clutter.

Here is what I sold and how much I walked away with:

1. A solid wood dresser that I spun as a Mid Century Modern item: $350
2. A set of retro orange chairs that I also spun as Mid Century Modern: $240
3. A slightly scuffed up but perfectly functional ping pong table: $200
4. An antique Coco Cola bar sign: $80
5. Coffee table: $40
6. Lightly used boxing gloves: $30

This earned me a total of $940, which I was happy with considering they were items I no longer had use for, I had a cleaner house, and felt good knowing I had contributed to the up cycling movement.

Two take-aways if you are going to do this: first, study the comparables and price your item slightly lower for a quick sale; and second, be sure to use catchy or trendy titles to differentiate your ad (ie. I took advantage of Mid Century Modern items being in high demand).

This ranked number two because although it proved to be affordable and timely, it is more of a one time thing.

# Furniture Flipping

This side hustle does take a little bit of elbow grease, but if you enjoy a fixer upper, this will be right up your alley.

To find a flip, I simply searched Kijiji, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace for free furniture. It is actually shocking the amount of furniture that is in decent condition that people are willing to give away.

A common problem that people have is that they have large items they are not capable of moving and hence will let them go of for free. Luckily, I have a trailer so this was not a problem for me.

If you don’t have a trailer this is the perfect time to bug that friend or family member who has a truck or a van.

I always looked for things like solid wood tables, desks, dressers, and chairs. To be honest, I actually really enjoyed having my Sunday morning coffee and looking for these little gems.

***Tip: aviod any items that are seriously damaged or that couldn’t be spruced up with a coat of paint.***

I picked up these pine dressers for free, chalk painted them, and added some vintage looking handles I had laying around from a previous home improvement project. I sold the dressers for $370 on Facebook Marketplace.

I also sold a kitchen table that I put a fresh coat of paint on for $200 and an antique desk that I stained for $225.

In total, over 30 days these little fixer upper projects earned me $795. Not bad!

# Takeaways

So, drumroll…how much did I make from taking this leap of faith and thinking a little outside of the box?

> Over 3 months I made a total of $2,890!

Initially, I was doubtful about all three of these side hustles but admittedly, I have to eat my words. All three of these side hustles were quick, easy, and most importantly profitable. I now have almost $3,000 to put towards an investment that I would not have had without giving these side hustles a try.

*Lesson learned, don’t knock it ’til you try it.*
