As some of you might have noticed, I keep activating and deactivating my Instagram. I'm not a fan of social media. I try to stay away from it as much as possible. Social media is bad in every way possible. I know it has some positives but the negatives far outweigh the positives.

Just today, I logged in to my Instagram and I couldn't bear the bullshit that is being served there for even five minutes, I had to log out of it instantly. This happens when you stay away from social media for a while, you get used to the peace that social media less world provide. 

If you're a student(since you're following Upscify, chances are that you're)— you should stay away from social media. It's a rabbit hole full of distraction and garbage content. There are thousands of reasons for a human being to not use social media, but for a student, it's essential that s/he stay away from social media. 

Social media is only useful if you're a content creator or a celebrity, or you own a business if you're not any of these three— then stay the hell away from it. Let me give you a few reasons if you're still not convinced.

**\[1] Full of Distraction** — it's a no-brainer that social media is filled with distractions, you open Instagram for 2 minutes and end up wasting 2 hours scrolling endlessly through Reels featuring clowns. This is something that happens multiple times a day, you can evaluate how much time you waste by getting distracted.

**\[2] Worst for mental health** — [Go to this link](https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/) to read why Instagram is the worst app for mental health. I know most of you don't care about it because you're not seeing the immediate consequences. But one thing that you all can see is that it makes you self-conscious, you see thousands of people who look better than you, who are achieving far more than you(at least that is how they present themselves)— and you end up having self-doubt and lower self-confidence.

**\[3] Time wasting** — Do I really need to explain this one?

**\[4] Sleep deprivation** — Haha, ask your dark circles and messed up sleep schedule. 

**\[5] Decreases the attention span** — Attention span is the time for how long you can concentrate on a particular thing, with high usage of social media, your attention span decreases— which means your mind wanders and it gets harder for you to focus on studying(or anything else, for that matter).

**\[6] Fake news**

**\[7] Loss of motivation** — Accept it, those *studygrams* on Instagram make you feel miserable rather than motivated, because of their “robotic 14 hours schedules.”

**\[8] Reduces productivity** — You become a multitasker, you use your phone while doing other things— which is also bad for productivity.

And I can go on explaining a hundred more reasons, but that is useless. I haven't even accounted for the privacy and cyberbullying-related reasons.

If you're a student, stay 100 yards away from it, if you're a UPSC aspirant, don't even think about it. 

Now, some of you may say that rather than taking such a radical stand, we can strive for a balance. Well, good luck with that— as if you’ve not tried and failed that already a thousand times.

Also before you call me a hypocrite, Telegram isn't a social media, it's a messenger. And yeah, you can also call it a *semi-social-media* but here, on Telegram, you get only the distractions that you subscribe to, but on Instagram, you get the distractions even when you do not subscribe to them.

***This is my opinion, make your own decision.***
