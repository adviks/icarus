![Shape1](RackMultipart20211025-4-xhqw0d_html_1e122d95a8e3ed61.gif)

The philosophy of Plato is best known as the theory of ideas or theory of forms. It is the metaphysics of Plato. According to it, what is truly real is not the object we encounter in sensory experience, but rather forms or ideas which can be grasped only intellectually. Hence, according to Plato, over and above the world of sense perceptions, there is the transcendent world of ideas or forms. By idea or form, he meant the essence of a perceptual object.

For example, a cow is a perceptual object, but the idea of cow is *cowness* without which no cow would have been a cow.

Ideas are models and ideal entities; and objects are their faithful copies. In other words, the idea is a universal concept found in all objects of the same class.

According to Plato, the transcendent world of ideas is more real and just as moonlight is derivative of sunlight, the world of sense objects is derivative of the transcendent world of ideas. The reality of the sensuous object is directly proportionate to their being faithful copies of the transcendent world which consists of ideas or forms of beings.

Plato takes the help of metaphors to explain the theory of ideas. He says that ideas are patterns and things just imitate them or simply sensible things participate in their corresponding ideas.

## Cave Analogy

Imagine some people living in an underground cave sitting with their back to the mouth of the cave, their hands and feet are bound in such a way that they can only look at the back wall of the cave. Behind them, many human-like creatures are standing on top of the wall.

Because there is fire behind these people, it casts a flickering shadow on the back wall of the cave. So, the only thing that the cave dwellers can see is the shadow play thinking these shadows to be real because they are sitting since birth.

Now, imagine one of the cave dwellers manages to free himself. Immediately he asks himself that from where all these shadows on the wall are coming? He comes out and gets dazzled by the sharp sunlight and clarity of real figures. He manages to climb the wall and sees beyond fire he is even more dazzled. He will see colors, animals, plants, flowers, shapes, etc. He realizes that shadow in the cave is merely a reflection of the real thing. He will see the sun in the sky and realizes that this is what gives life to these plants, flowers, animals, etc. just as the fire made the shadows visible.

He goes back and tries to convince cave dwellers that these are merely a reflection of real things. But these prisoners do not agree with him. Instead, they kill him.

The cave represents the world we see and experience with our senses and the world of sunlight represents the realm of ideas or forms. The prisoners represent the ordinary people who take the world to be real and are condemned to darkness, error, ignorance, and illusion. The escaped prisoner represents the philosopher who has seen life, truth, beauty, knowledge, and true reality.

The philosopher who returns to the cave is considered mad by the prisoners. This difficulty is sometimes faced by those who have seen the truth and decided to tell others about it.

## Theory of Ideas

Plato&#39;s theory of ideas is based on the reflection on the world of sense observations. In the practical world of sense observation, there is nothing absolute or immutable, that is, all is flux. Under the influence of growth and decay, things exhibit many varying and contradictory properties. For example, food that nourishes today may kill tomorrow because of the decaying. From these reflections on the nature of practical reality, Plato concluded that there could be no definite knowledge based on sense observation. Hence, the sensuous world or the world of appearance cannot be the object of knowledge.

From this fact, it follows that there must be another world, independent of the sensuous world, which is the object of knowledge. This world must be transcendent ideally and apprehensible by reason alone. This is the transcendent world of ideas or forms.

Thus, Plato establishes a dichotomy of existence or two-realm concept. That is the world exists at two levels. The properties of the two levels are diverse. Whereas the sensuous world is transient, mortal, temporal, etc. the transcendental world is immutable, immortal, and non-temporal. This Platonic dualism was incorporated into Christianity and transmitted to the ages to our thoughts today.

According to Plato, it is the rational insight that gives us knowledge of ideas and forms. It is not subject to sensory knowledge and is unhindered by sensory perception. It does not give us knowledge of things. It is not knowledge of particulars, but knowledge of universal. So far as each object participates in a certain universal, the knowledge of universal gives some knowledge of the object. This rational insight is the basis of Plato&#39;s theory of ideas or forms.

### Validity or justification

Plato further tries to establish the validity and rationality of the existence of the transcendent world. In the practical world, if we wish to know the meaning of the concepts like beauty, sweetness, justice, etc. we can only point to certain particular objects which illustrate these concepts. Since such concepts are found only exemplified in the actual world and are not found as such in spatial-temporal existence, these must exist in the world which is beyond space and time. For example, circularity is not found as such in the physical world. What we find are the things that approach perfect circularity. But they are not perfect circulars. That is, circularity is an example of form or idea.

### Arguments In Favor of Theory of Ideas

Plato has advanced various arguments to establish his Theory of ideas. Aristotle considered five of these as the chief. They are as follows:

1. The argument from science
2. The argument of one over many
3. The argument from the knowledge of things that are no more
4. The argument from relations
5. The argument implying the fallacy of the third man

#### 1. The argument from science

According to the reasoning of this argument, knowledge, and science must be definite and real. They must enjoy unambiguous ontological status. But in our practical world, we find nothing which is definite, permanent, and immutable. All worldly things are subject to change and therefore variable. Therefore, these cannot be objects of knowledge.

The knowledge, therefore, can only be transcendent. The objects of knowledge can only be those which are immutable and absolute and these must be transcendent. Plato believed that concepts or forms are immutable, permanent, and real. Plato has called these immutable and absolute objects &quot;Ideas&quot; or &quot;Forms&quot;. For example, mathematics is a science, but in the practical applications of mathematics, the number, straight lines, and point, etc. only exemplify them. We do not have an object which corresponds to the idea of a point or straight line.

The ideal definition of a straight line is that of the shortest distance between two points and that of the point that it has position but no magnitude. Now, we cannot possibly imagine anything in space and time which has a position and no magnitude. This consideration alone leads us to believe that the objects of the world are but imperfect copies of an ideal and perfect form. Therefore, the objects of mathematical knowledge are not, to be found in our day-to-day- world but in the transcendent world which is apprehensible not by any sense but by reason alone.

#### 2. The argument of One over Many

This argument reasons that the various particulars in the practical world have certain similarities with each other due to which they are considered of one class and subsumed under a single concept or idea. For example, there are men, animals, plants, stones, etc. in this world.

All particular men are called so because, in all of them, there is a quality of manliness. Now, this quality or idea of manliness must exist somewhere. It cannot exist in particulars because if it exists in a particular it must also exist in another particular and then there will be many concepts of the same type. But this is illogical, therefore the concept must be singular and it cannot exist in our spatiotemporal world.

#### 3. The Argument from the knowledge of things that are no more

This argument reasons that while particular things are born and die, the form or the concept of which they are copies or illustrations ever remains. For example, men keep being born and dying but the idea or concept of manliness is permanent and preserves through all changes. It is neither born nor dies: but is immortal.

#### 4. The argument from relations

All things classified under a concept are not uniformly equal but are more or less different from each other yet they are known by the same name. This is because they follow more or less perfectly the ideal form or concept. Only the concept is wholly perfect.

#### 5. The argument implying the fallacy of the third man

This argument reasons that a set of particulars is called by a single name because all the particulars of the set have some common features. However, none of these has these features perfectly. For example, Ram, Shyam, Sohan are all men, because in all of them the characteristic of manhood is found, that is, all have the qualities of rationality and animality. But no particular man is perfectly rational and animal.

However, the idea of a perfect rational creature is indispensable; otherwise, we cannot recognize a rational animal. As there can be no copy without an original, there can be no particular rational creature without a universal rational creature. Therefore, Ideas or concepts must exist outside of particulars.

### Characteristics of Ideas

Plato advances many arguments to establish his theory of ideas. For Plato, the realm of ideas is the realm of reality and of being while that of percepts is the realm of becoming.

1. The substance is that which is &quot;in itself and for itself&#39;&#39; and does not require the existence of anything else for itself reality. For Plato, the idea is &quot;in itself and for itself&quot;. In philosophy, the substance is defined as a substratum that persists through changes; is unaffected by them; is immutable and eternal. The &#39;ideas&#39;, as we have seen earlier possess these qualities. Nothing other than &#39;ideas&#39; has these qualities. Therefore, ideas are according to Plato, substances.
2. Ideas are universal Such as cowness, beauty, etc. Particular things only imitate and copy an idea. For example, beautiful things imitate the idea of beauty.

According to Plato, ideas are already there in the intellect of man in the dormant stage. Sensible things only participate in ideas and serve as provocative agencies for evoking the reminiscence of ideas when a man once experienced them in their pristine glorious existence.

According to Plato, the soul is immortal and in its pristine existence, it enjoys the pure experience. But, at present, the soul is in bondage and continues in bondage till it regains its pristine glorious existence through proper philosophical knowledge through meditation on the idea of Good. As long as the soul does not regain its release, it passes an endless cycle of rebirth. Thus, learning of ideas is recollection (recollection theory or reminiscence theory)

1. Ideas are eternal. They are eternal in the sense that they are timeless. Time was created by God along with the world, but ideas pre-exist the creation of the world and would remain even when the world would be destroyed. For example, even if all cows die, the cowness will remain.
2. Ideas are immutable, non-composite, pure, and simple.
3. Ideas are non-sensible or supersensible. They are not objects of sense-perception but are apprehensible by reason alone. They can only be thought of.
4. Each idea is one, unique and indivisible. Of course, the idea of beauty is one, but it is imitated or copied by many beautiful things.
5. Each idea in its kind is absolute. As ideas are absolute, they are invariable and constant. For example, a child grows into an adolescent, youth, old, and then dies. But, with this change idea of manliness remains the same.
6. Ideas are the essence of things in the sense that they are real and sensible things are their imitation.
7. Ideas are beyond space and time. For example, a cow could be described in space and time, but the idea of cow, that is, cowness is transcendental and hence, beyond space and time.
8. Plato is pluralist. He believes in the independent existence of all ideas, but all ideas do not enjoy equal roles and importance in the transcendental world. There is a hierarchical order of ideas in the transcendental world. Ideas representing material objects are at the lowest, followed by ideas that possess quality and so on. In other words, more inclusive ideas are of higher-order and which are less inclusive are of lower order. For example, the idea of color and the idea of blue.

In this hierarchy, the idea of Good is the highest idea. According to Plato, the world of ideas is the system of ideas in which various ideas perform their respective role. But all the roles are subordinate to the role played by the Good.

### Idea of Good

According to Plato, the idea of Good is the ultimate reality. It is the highest idea. It is the substratum of the universe. It occupies the same place as that of substance in the philosophy of Spinoza or Brahman in the philosophy of Shankaracharya.

It is the highest knowledge, highest value, and supreme existence. It is free, self-existent, and perfect. It is the truth, good and beautiful. It is the summum bonum of human life. It is the aim of all desires, activities, and excellence. All human beings and other creatures and even gods aim at its attainment. It is the only extent of participation of the idea of Good that makes anything useful or good. Metaphysically, it is the cause of the universe.

The physical world is only appearance. Just as light is due to the sun, not the sun itself, similarly the world of existence is due to the idea of Good but is not the idea of Good itself.

The idea of good, the ultimate reality, is indescribable. It is beyond finite, speech and thoughts; beyond senses, language, and worldly experiences, and therefore, can be best described just as Brahman is described in the Upanishads as neti-neti.

## Theory of Knowledge

Knowledge is true ultimately because it is knowledge of what is. Plato believed that it is not enough to know the truth; rather a person must also become the truth. This is where Plato&#39;s theory of knowledge, that is epistemology, becomes metaphysics or theory of being. For Plato to know is to be. The more you know, the more you are and the better you are.

The myth of the cave shows how and why human beings are in the dark about the truth of things. What allows human beings eventually to come into light regarding the truth of things is the form or idea. Each individual has in his or her immortal soul a perfect set of forms and ideas that can be remembered and only that constitutes true knowledge. To remember the forms is to know the absolute truth and simultaneously become just and wise.

Plato believed in two radically separate spheres. These are realms of shadows or imperfect changing beings and the realm of perfect, eternal, and unchangeable forms. The problem is how we get out of the cave to the perfect world of forms. In this regard, Plato postulates the notion of love as how a person can go from the state of imperfection and ignorance to the state of perfection and true knowledge. He defined love as longingness and a striving to attain the object of longing.

For Plato, love is meant to be the force that brings all things together and makes them beautiful. It is the way by which all beings, especially human beings, can ascend to higher stages of self-realization and perfection. It is this intellectual and spiritual love that begins the ascent which may eventually lead to permanent possession of absolute beauty or goodness. Thus, for Plato love is the ultimate way of knowing and realizing the absolute and ultimate truth.

### Critical Comment on Plato&#39;s Theory of Idea

1. According to Aristotle, no essence of anything can be outside of it, but for Plato, ideas are in the intelligible world, away from the things which belong to the world of becoming. According to Aristotle, it is absurd because the idea or the essence must be in the thing of which it is the essence.
2. How can ideas explain the world of particular things? How can the idea of whiteness explain the particular white things? If we could show that white cows, white flowers; etc. logically follow from whiteness, then alone we could say that idea of whiteness explains the white things of the world. But according to Aristotle, there is no logical relationship between them.

Even if we say, that white is the common element in all the things called white, the change or movement in white things does not get explained thereby.

Plato's view is static, as we find later in the philosophy of Spinoza. However,

Aristotle's point of view is dynamic as we find later in the philosophy of Leibnitz.

1. Aristotle says the idea as causes are mere double the things to be explained. Ideas are as many as are the particular which they want to explain.
2. According to Plato, the idea is a substance that can exist in the intelligible world without being instantiated. However, according to Aristotle, the idea must exist only in particular i.e., individuals. Hence, the substance is a concrete individual. According to Aristotle, a substance has three elements.
3. Universal
4. Qualifies, relation, etc.
5. An unknown substratum called matter by itself.

According to Aristotle, a universal without qualities and substratum does not exist. Therefore, according to Aristotle the idea of Plato is not substance because ideas exist apart from individuals, without qualities and unknown substratum.

1. Aristotle points out that Plato's theory of ideas cannot establish, any logical relationship between ideas and particular things; If the sensible idea is like the non-sensible idea, then, the idea too will be like the sensible. In that case, we require another pattern, which will explain the likeness between both of them. It leads to the fallacy of the third man.

An idea is a common element that is found in many particulars.

E.g., The idea of man is found in many individual men, but there is also an element, which is common to individual man and idea man, this requires a third man to illustrate a common element in individual man and the idea man. This again would require another idea to show the common element between it and the idea man. Hence, it would lead to the fallacy of infinite regression.

1. Plato held that each idea is one and indivisible and non-sensuous. But here the question arises, do individual horses participate in one indivisible horseness or the whole of horseness idea.

If so then the idea will be in as many places as they are the individual horses and the idea of horseness gets divided. If only a part of the idea of horseness participates in each of them, then again, the idea gets divided. Hence, there can be no idea as one indivisible.

1. According to Plato, idea is the pattern which individual things copy. However, it leads to a contradiction. E.g., Man is the pattern of men, but itself becomes a copy to its genus called animals.

### Four Types of Knowledge

In his magnum opus— *The Republic*, Plato has presented his views concerning epistemology. Here he discussed the following four types of knowledge-Conjectural, Practical or Sensuous, Hypothetical, and finally Rational.

#### 1. Conjectural Knowledge

Conjectural knowledge is the lowest type of knowledge. It is not knowledge but a mere appearance of it. It includes illusions, hallucinations, dreams, and pathological experiences, etc. Thus, the knowledge of a snake in a rope, silver in nacre and the double moon in the sky, the mirage in the desert, etc., and the words like hare&#39;s horn and son of a barren woman corner within conjecture} knowledge. Thus, it deals with illusory experiences and ideas. It is always erroneous. It is never actual but always possible though it influences people.

#### 2. Practical or Sensuous knowledge

While conjectural knowledge of Plato can be compared to Pratibhasika's knowledge of Samkara Vedanta, the practical or sensuous knowledge may be compared with Samkara's Vyavaharika knowledge. As is clear from its title it is the knowledge of the world, the knowledge received through various sense organs. Thus, our knowledge of things is practical.

This knowledge, though considered to be final by a man of common sense, has been demonstrated as only a possible knowledge by the philosophers. Things are not as they appear to us. What they are in reality, we do not know but we know that our knowledge concerning things is conditioned by our mental mechanism. As Kant pointed out in tradition with Plato's epistemology, man&#39;s knowledge is a result of a synthesis between percept and concepts.

##### Is Knowledge Perception?

While discussing the idea of Protagoras that knowledge is perception Plato has pointed out that this is an opinion and not knowledge. According to Protagoras and Sophist thinkers, knowledge achieved through sense organs is true knowledge. Such a view, however, is falsified by our everyday experiences. No reliable predictions can be made based on such knowledge. As David Hume pointed out, in tradition with Plato&#39;s epistemology, sensory experiences lead to ideas that are possible but not necessary.

Again, our perceptual knowledge at times is self-contradictory. An object near to us appears to be bigger than the same object at a far distance. In comparison to a heavy thing, something may appear lighter but in comparison to a lighter thing, the same thing may appear heavier. Thus, as Gestalt psychologists, later on, pointed out, in tradition with Plato, an object is influenced by its field. All perceptions are in a certain background and this background influences our sensory experiences. The same object in a White, red, or black background appears to be having different colors. Similar is the case with geometrical and other forms.

Now, which of these contradictory experiences may be considered as representing the actual object? It is clear that none of these experiences represents the object but only a facet of it that is related to space-time. Sensory experiences do not give us universal and eternal knowledge. They are temporary and fallible though useful for practical purposes. However true they may be considered in the field of practical life; the scientists agree with the philosophers that they are possible and not necessary.

If we accept with Protagoras that knowledge is the perception it will result in the impossibility of all education, discourse, and validity. If all the perceptions are equally true, then there is hardly any distinction between the perception of untrained and trained persons. The educator therefore will have nothing to teach to the educand. Similarly, a discourse generally consists of two opposite sides, both of which are based upon certain experiences. If experiences alone were sufficient to guarantee the validity of knowledge, both sides of discourse may be equally true which leads to the contradictory position that contraries are equally true.

Similarly, contradictory theories of validity will be equally valid which will make an assessment of validity impossible. One will have to accept that while his perceptions are valid for himself, others&#39; perceptions are valid for others. Using this reasoning known as turning the tables, Democritus has criticized the above-mentioned theory advanced by Protagoras.

If perceptions were knowledge, one must admit all objects of perception. Man, however, is not the only perceiver. The animals and birds of different varieties have sense organs that perceive in a way different from that of human beings. Protagoras has not explained whether the perceptions of human beings alone are valid or equal validity may be granted to perceptions of the animals. Thus, his dictum that knowledge is perception is self-contradictory. According to it, truth is what appears to be true. If it is so there is hardly any question of the validity of truth.

The theory advanced by Protagoras will eliminate objectivity from the field of knowledge. It is against the objectivity of truth and fails to distinguish between tenth and falsehood. Nothing can be true and untrue at the same time. It can be true for one and untrue for another, but not both for the same person. It may be admitted that while what I perceive is true for me others&#39; perceptions may be true for them, but if the same thing is perceived differently by different persons, we must have criteria for assessing the objectivity of truth.

Besides, some phenomena are not subject to perception. For example, universals are not subject to perception. We may perceive human beings but not humanity, the universal found among human beings. Similarly, words such as equality, liberty, fraternity, and all values are not subject to perception and yet they have not been accepted as false. The processes of classification, comparison, imagination, and reasoning include a wide variety of phenomena that are not subject to perception. In the perception of a white piece of paper the perceptions of whiteness and paper etc. require classification as well as comparison, which however are not sensory processes. Each sensation, as distinct from another sensation, involves comparison by the human mind.

Kant rightly pointed out that without the subsumption of forms of intuition under categories of ideas and finally their synthesis in the unity of apperception knowledge is not possible. All these processes, as Kant rightly pointed out, are a priori i.e., not subject to perception. All knowledge involves a double cognition. While on the one hand, my perception of a piece of paper shows the existence of an object outside me, it also proves the existence of a perceptual mechanism in my mind. Therefore, the dictum that knowledge is perception is oversimplified and unscientific.

#### 3. Hypothetical knowledge.

This knowledge, as is clear by its title, is not final but hypothetical. It is similarly not sensory or practical. It includes the knowledge of numbers and forms as found in different branches of mathematics. As David Hume pointed out, in Platonic traditions, all mathematical knowledge is exact but not actual since whatever is necessary is not factual.

In hypothetical knowledge we arrive at certain conclusions through the processes of inductive generalizations and logical deductions, the truth of these generalizations and deductions is hypothetical as it depends upon the validity of sensory knowledge. In mathematics, the basic definitions as those of point, line, etc. are taken as axioms. They are not derived from such sensory perceptions but are defined as such. Deductions made based on these definitions, therefore, are not real though necessary. In Platonic epistemology, hypothetical knowledge is the mediator between practical sensuous Knowledge and rational insight. In Other Words, it establishes a relation between the world of things.

#### 4. Rational insight

In platonic epistemology rational insight is the highest form of knowledge. Thus, Plato can be called the forerunner of rationalist philosophy in the West. Rational insight gives us knowledge of forms, concepts, or ideas. It is achieved through a dialectical process unhindered by sensory perceptions. It is not subject to sensory knowledge.

### Knowledge is not opinion

Besides rejecting the theory of Protagoras that knowledge is perception, Plato has also rejected another current theory of his time knowledge is the opinion. According to Plato, Knowledge is not opinion, neither right opinion nor wrong opinion. For example, if a person declares that the Government will resign next Saturday, this is not knowledge even if it comes out to be true accidentally. Right opinion again, is mostly a blind guess and therefore cannot be called knowledge proper. For Example, if our conscience intuitively or instinctively believes in a certain thing and cannot lay down reasons for such a belief, it cannot be called knowledge of the reasons why it is so.

### Knowledge is not instinctive belief but complete understanding.

It is rational comprehension. Thus, it is not based on faith, but reason. An orator utilizing the sentiments of the audience can make them believe in his opinion but he cannot create knowledge. An opinion can be changed by arousing emotions and sentiments and therefore it is unstable and indefinite. Knowledge, on the other hand, cannot be changed like this. One who knows cannot be be-fooled by verbal jugglery.

### While knowledge is always true

Opinions both right and wrong, are always false. Distinguishing between knowledge and right opinion Plato has advanced the argument that instruction can implant knowledge. While this is not true about right opinion, knowledge and true reason are invariable related and found together. Right opinion, knowledge, and true reason are invariably related and found together. The right opinion is irrational. It can be changed by stimuli and motivation. It can be divided among participants. This, however, is not true about knowledge that can be shared only by rational human beings. Comparing the role of opinion and knowledge is pure being, opinion lies in between Being and non - Being. In other words, opinion is in between knowledge and ignorance.

## Theory of Divided Line

Explaining the world in which we live has been the essential pursuit of Philosophy since the beginning. Many have accounted for the world in different ways; from what substance, everything is made being the usual quest. Plato&#39;s &quot;Divided Line&quot; is one of the most studied and famous explanations of the world. It not only explains its essence but the theory of knowledge according to Plato. It represents the synthetic viewpoint of Plato&#39;s epistemology and metaphysics.

This ideology is demonstrated through a line, which separates four metaphysical models of knowledge and the world. These models are not completely separate, but more of a ladder in which man must realize the next step of clarity by building off the last; the journey from ignorance to true knowledge.

Let us define the four different parts of the Divided Line. The line divides the world into two main fields;

**Opinion / visible** : The visible world is perceived by the senses and subject to change. The opinion is divided into

1. Conjectural (illusion) world
2. Perceptual (practical) world

**Knowledge, or intelligible world** : The intelligible world cannot be perceived by the senses, but only l known and understood. This world is not subject to change, but rather is eternal and within it holds universal ideals. Knowledge, or the intelligible world, is divided into

1. Hypothetical
2. Rational insight
