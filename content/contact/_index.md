Feel free to reach out to me for anything — feedback, suggestion, appreciation, constructive criticism — **or just to say "Hi".**

The best way to reach out to me is via email. I love email. In this world on instant-messaging, I still like the slow old emailing. 

So here is my email address:

**hello@asadadvik.com**

*(You can click on the email above to send me a mail)*

I'll be waiting for your mail. See you 👋
